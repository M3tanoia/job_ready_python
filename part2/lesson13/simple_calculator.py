#Design a function called simple_calculator that performs basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two operands. Use the function to create a program that allows the user to perform simple calculations on two numbers. For example, the program should allow the user to input two numbers of their choice, perform the selected operation on the numbers, and display the result.
