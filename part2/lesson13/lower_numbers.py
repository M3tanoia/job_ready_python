#Write a program that performs the following tasks:

#Accept at least five and no more than ten integers from the user and store the values in a list.
#Give the user the option to stop input after receiving five numbers.
#Stop accepting input when the user chooses to stop or when there are ten numbers in the list.
#Calculate the average value of the input numbers and use this value as a threshold.
#Create a find_lower function that accepts the list of numbers and the threshold value as parameters and then calculates and displays the values from the list that are lower than the threshold value.
