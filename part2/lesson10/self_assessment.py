#This exercise is a bit more complicated and provided as a self-assessment, allowing you to check your knowledge and readiness for the next lesson.

#Create a program that does the following. You will notice this is similar to what you've done with lists and tuples:

#Define a dictionary with at least five elements.
#Ask the user to enter a key.
#If the key already exists, ask the user for an operation (“update” or “remove”).
#If the operation is “remove”:
#Remove the entry from the dictionary and display the updated dictionary to the user.
#If the operation is “update”:
#Ask the user to enter a value to be added with the key.
#Update the value in the dictionary for the key.
#Display the updated dictionary to the user.
#If the entered key does not exist, display a message saying it is a new key and ask the user to enter the value to be added. When the user enters the value, display the new list.
#Repeat until the user enters “quit.”
#When the user enters “quit,” display the original dictionary, the final version of the updated dictionary, and the differences between the two.
