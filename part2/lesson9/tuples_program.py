#This exercise checks your knowledge and readiness for the next lesson by having you pull together everything you've learned into a complete program. This exercise is the same as Exercise 5 in Lesson 8, except instead of using lists, you use tuples. Create a new program that does all the following:

#Creates a tuple with at least five elements.
#Asks the user for their first name.
#Asks the user for their last name.
#Asks the user for a value.
#Asks the user for an operation (“add” or “remove”).
#If the operation is “remove”:
#If the value exists in the set, remove the value from the tuple and display the updated tuple to the user.
#If the value does not exist in the tuple, display a user-friendly error message.
#If the operation is “add”:
#If the value exists in the tuple, display a user-friendly error message.
#If the value does not exist in the tuple, add the value to the tuple, and display the updated set to the user.
#Repeat until the user enters “quit.”
#When the user enters “quit,” display the original set, the final version of the updated tuple, and the difference between the two tuples, along with their first name and last name concatenated.
