#This exercise checks your knowledge and readiness by having you pull together everything you've learned into a complete program. Create a new program that does all of the following:

#Create a list with at least five elements.
#Ask the user for their first name.
#Ask the user for their last name.
#Ask the user for a value.
#Ask the user for an operation (“add” or “remove”).
#If the operation is “remove”:
#If the value exists in the set, remove the value from the list, and display the updated list to the user.
#If the value does not exist in the list, display a user-friendly error message.
#If the operation is “add”:
#If the value exists in the list, display a user-friendly error message.
#If the value does not exist in the list, add the value to the list, and display the updated set to the user.
#Repeat until the user enters “quit.”
#When the user enters “quit,” display the original set, the final version of the updated list, and the difference between the two lists, along with their first name and last name concatenated.
