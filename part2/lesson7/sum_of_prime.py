#Write a Python script that determines if an input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, the number 10 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers:

#10 = 3 + 7 : both prime numbers
#10 = 5 + 5 : both prime numbers

#However, the number 11 cannot be:

#11 = 1 + 10 : neither 1 nor 10 are prime numbers
#11 = 2 + 9 : 9 is not a prime number
#11 = 3 + 8 : 8 is not a prime number
#11 = 4 + 7 : 4 is not a prime number
#11 = 5 + 6 : 6 is not a prime number
