#Write a program that performs the following steps:

#Ask the user for a number.
#Output a count starting with 0.
#Display the count number if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.
#Replace every multiple of 3 with the word “fizz.”
#Replace every multiple of 5 with the word “buzz.”
#Replace multiples of both 3 and 5 with “fizz buzz.”
#Continue counting until the number of integers replaced with “fizz,” “buzz,” or “fizz buzz” reaches the input number.
#The last output line should read “TRADITION!!”
