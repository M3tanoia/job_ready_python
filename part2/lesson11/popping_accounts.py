#The functionality of using pop() can be used in the ERP banking application for extracting and removing a specific erroneous value. Create a script that performs the following steps:

#Display the set to the user along with the number of items in the set.
#Ask the user if they want to remove an item from the set.
#If the user says yes:
#Verify that there is at least one item in the set.
#Remove a random item from the set.
#Display the updated set to the user.
#Prompt the user to remove another item.
#If there are no items in the set, display an output message to that effect and end the script.
#If the user says no, end the script.
#Don't use the clear(), remove(), or discard() methods in your solution. Here is the first line of code to get you started:

account_numbers = {"L000012","L000023","S0001243","C122399" }
