#This exercise is provided as a self-assessment, allowing you to check your knowledge and readiness for the next lesson. This assessment combines concepts presented in the lesson in a single program without the guidance provided in the lesson activities. You'll notice this is similar to Exercise 4 in Lesson 10, but this time sets are used. Use your program to do the following:

#Define a set with at least five elements.
#Ask the user for a value.
#Ask the user for an operation (“add” or “remove”).
#If the operation is “remove”:
#If the value exists in the set, remove the value from the set, and display the updated set to the user.
#If the value does not exist in the set, display “Sorry, the value does not exist.”
#If the operation is “add”:
#If the value exists in the set, display “your item exists.”
#If the value does not exist in the set, add the value to the set, and display the updated set to the user.
#Repeat until the user enters “quit.”
#When the user enters “quit,” display the original set, the final version of the updated set, and the difference between the two sets.
