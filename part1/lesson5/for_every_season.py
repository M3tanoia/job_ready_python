#Write a program that uses elif to produce five different possible outcomes based on a single user input:

#Ask the user what season it is (fall, winter, spring, or summer).
#If the user enters fall, output “I bet the leaves are pretty there!”
#If the user enters winter, output “I hope you're ready for snow!”
#If the user enters spring, output “I can smell the flowers!”
#If the user enters summer, output “Make sure your AC is working!”
#If the user enters a value that does not correspond to a season, output “I don't recognize that season.”
#The user should be able to enter the name of the season in any case and the program will still work.

#Challenge: After you have the program working as describe here, modify the program so that the user can enter either “fall” or “autumn” and get the same result.
