#Write a program that performs the following steps:

#Ask the user if they own any cats. (Yes/No answer)
#Ask the user if they own any dogs. (Yes/No answer)
#If the user's responses indicate that they have both cats and dogs, output “You must really love pets!”
#Otherwise, the output should be “Maybe you need more pets.”
#The last step will apply if the user has cats but not dogs, dogs but not cats, or neither cats nor dogs.

#Write two different versions of this program: one that uses only if statements and another that uses if-else statements.
