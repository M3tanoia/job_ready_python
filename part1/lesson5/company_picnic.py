#Your company has organized a morale event. They're hosting a picnic and field day in the park, and of course, they want to play team-building games.

#To do that they want to assign the attendees to certain teams based on their last name. They've already chosen the team names, but they want you to write a program that will sort each person into the correct team.

#Here are the specs:

#If a person's name starts with A, B, C, or D, then they are on the team “Red Dragons.”
#If the name starts with E, F, G, or H, they are on the team “Dark Wizards.”
#If the name starts with I, J, K, or L, they are on the team “Moving Castles.”
#If the name starts with M, N, O, or P, they are on the team “Golden Snitches.”
#If the name starts with Q, R, S, or T, they are on the team “Night Guards.”
#If the name stars with U, V, W, X, Y, or Z, they are on the team “Black Holes.”
#Here's an example of the output:

#What's your last name? Weasley
#Aha! You're on the team "Black Holes"!
#Good luck in the games!
#The example uses the person's last name, but you can choose to use first names if you prefer. You may also use a different output message as long as it clearly states what team the person is on.
