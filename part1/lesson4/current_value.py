#Write a program that calculates and displays the current value of a deposit for a given initial deposit, 
#interest rate, how many times interest is calculated per year, and the number of years since the initial deposit.

#The program should prompt the user for each of the values and use the following formula to calculate the current value of the deposit:

#   V = P(1 + r/n)^nt

#where

#   V	=	value
#   P	=	initial deposit
#   r	=	interest rate as a fraction (e.g., 0.05)
#   n	=	the number of times per year interest is calculated
#   t	=	the number of years since the initial deposit

#The program should display each of the values entered in a meaningful way to the user 
#(so that the user can easily see what each value represents, along with the results of the calculation).
