#Create a program that prompts the user for a number and calculates the following:

#The Boolean of the number entered
#The binary equivalent of the number entered
#The square root of the number entered
#The program should display the following to the user:

#The number the user entered, in a phrase like, “You selected value.”
#The Boolean of the number, in a phrase like, “The Boolean of your number is value.”
#The binary equivalent of the number, in a phrase like, “The binary equivalent of your number is value.”
#The square root of the number, in a phrase like, “The square root of your number is value,” with the value rounded to three decimal places.
